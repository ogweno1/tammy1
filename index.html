                    The Social Security Administration is one of the largest agencies within the federal government and
                    maneuvering the "red tape" of proving a disability claim can take you to the breaking point.
                    Bureaucracy and human suffering mix about as well as oil and water.
                </p>
                <img class="image-width-contain image-vertical-padded hidden-md-up center-block"

                <p>
                    Disability claims are won and lost on medical evidence. Sometimes, Claimants have no evidence and
                    their claims are denied. Other times, Claimants have the wrong kind of evidence and their claims are
                    denied. The Social Security Administration does not make distinguishing the "right" kind of evidence
                    from the "wrong" kind an easy task. Having an attorney who speaks the "language" of disability
                    claims and understands the medical evidence needed to win a disability claim can mean the difference
                    between a favorable decision and an unfavorable one. That is where the Law Office of Tammy M.
                    Holcomb
                    comes in.

                    I have been practicing in the area of Social Security Disability since my very first day as an
                    attorney. I take a very personalized approach to my cases, having regular contact with my clients
                    regarding their medical treatment, the status of their disability claim, and all of the unique
                    things that make them who they are. As with my practice in general, I never lose sight of the fact
                    that I am helping people...not file numbers.

                    You have had an accident. You're injured. Now, you're facing the decision about whether to hire an
                    attorney. Hiring an attorney is an important decision...whom to hire is equally so.
                </p>
                <img class="image-width-contain image-vertical-padded hidden-md-up center-block"
                     src="img/ambulance.jpeg"/>
                <p>
                    When I meet with people who have been injured in an accident, the most common question they ask is:
                    "Why do I need an attorney?" The answer is that you do not need an attorney. Many people are capable
                    of resolving their own accident cases, and some are capable of filing a lawsuit and winning without
                    hiring an attorney. However, the cost of going it alone is often one that cannot be measured in
                    dollars and cents and is, instead, measured in tears and higher blood pressure readings.
                </p>
                <img class="image-width-contain image-vertical-padded hidden-md-up center-block"
                     src="img/snarling-dog.jpeg"/>
                <p>
                    Keeping that in mind, perhaps a better question is "How does an attorney benefit me?" The answer
                    boils down to priorities. Your healing and your peace of mind should always be the priority. Having
                    an attorney to fight for you restores your focus to yourself and not to the details of an insurance
                    claim which can easily overwhelm you. Instead of spending countless hours on the telephone with an
                    insurance adjuster and jumping through their hoops, you can focus on what really matters - YOUR
                    HEALTH and YOUR LIFE. When you are not the one calling the adjuster, faxing medical bills to the
                    adjuster, justifying your choice of provider to the adjuster, and/or arguing with the adjuster about
                    the value of your claim, you are healing instead of adding fuel to the fire of physical pain and
                    emotional upheaval.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second most common question I hear is "Why should I hire you?" I answer this question by
                    pointing out that I have always done things differently when it comes to taking care of people. It
                    is in my nature to go above and beyond what is expected of me if that means the best outcome for the
                    person whom I am trying to help. In an attorney/client relationship, communication is key.
                    Throughout my career, I have set myself apart from "the pack" by being personally available to my
                    clients. I am available by telephone and in person. And, I do not wait for you to call me before
                    communicating updates in your case. Instead, I initiate contact with you. If you leave a message,
                    your call will be returned. If you send an email, your email will be answered. It is a very simple
                    formula and it has served me well in my career.

                    Like you, I am a real person with a family, friends, and hobbies. I believe the practice of law is
                    about relationship building and not just about the bottom line. Give me a call or send me an email
